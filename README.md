#Contact-Center-Overview 

Contact centers also known as customer service centers operate in a similar way to call centers, however, they handle additional forms of communication channels apart from phone calls. Contact centers also expand to include all other communications as well. Contact centers take an Omni channel approach, incorporating not only voice communication, but also live web chats, text messaging, messenger apps, email, video chat, social media, and are even involved in managing virtual agents and chatbots.

In this project we use a dataset from ‘Real World Fake Data’.
Preparation of the data in the CSV file was done using Microsoft Excel.
The CSV file was then imported into MySQL Workbench.
Cleaning and analysis of the data was done using SQL. 
Finally, a visualization of the data was created using Tableau. 
The tutorial/article for this project was offered by Armonia from medium.com.
